## Updates
**22/12/21** -- Updated 3d models for motor holders, successfully added electromagnet control and debugged robot code, and executed wireless control of motors and electromagnet, and rearrangement of files <br/><br/>
**15/12/21** -- Created the 3d models for the motor holders using Fusion360 <br/><br/>
**14/12/21** -- Debugged motor code as control for the steering left was not working, hooked up all the motors to make sure motors can work for movement in all directions <br/><br/>
**11/12/21** -- Integrated Motor code wih Client code to control one motor wirelessly <br/><br/>
**9/12/21** -- Debugged controller code and transmitted data from server to client for robot control <br/><br/>
